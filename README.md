## Overview

Fohat is a GUI tool that allow us create by a simple way XML files used to loading R&D projects information into the Aneel pipeline.

- **Simple**: By using Graphical Interface, it is not necessary that you have knowledge about how Aneel XML syntax and structure is used and building in each file type.
- **Saves time**: Writing XML files manually may waste several time and is possible that mistakes are made. Using Fohat XML you will save time filling only the fields that really matter without worrying with the final structure and XML syntax.
- **All files type in one tool**: R&D projects submmiteds to Aneel pipeline has many stages which need different XML files (E.g.: start, prorrogation, final report, audit report etc.). Fohat has all XML types therefore you just need choose which one you want.
